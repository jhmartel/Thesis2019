"Applications of Optimal Transportation to Algebraic Singularity: How to Construct Spines from Singularity"
by J.H.Martel, 2019.

Attached is my 2019 PhD Thesis at the Univesity of Toronto, supervised by Prof. R.J. McCann. 
Given a discrete group Γ we describe explicit models of Eilenberg-Maclane EΓ classifying spaces by representing Spines as the Singularities of optimal transportation problems, with respect to an anti-quadratic cost modelled on energies of ion configurations.
